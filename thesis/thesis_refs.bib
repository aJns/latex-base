abstract = {Actuation is used in all vehicles (aircraft, spacecraft, ground vehicles, etc) to control the position and/or attitude of the vehicle, and also to deploy or retract equipment, particularly for embedded optic instruments (cameras, telescopes). As such, the actuation is a safety critical system, particularly when humans could be catastrophically affected by failures within the system. Applications for actuation are flight controls, landing gear, rotors, suspension, antennae steering, valves, scanning, positioning using hydraulic, electromechanical, magnetic and piezo actuators. In aircraft there is a common goal to reduce the number of hydraulic actuators in vehicles and eventually to replace them completely by electric actuators. The interest for smart suspensions is pushing magnetorheological fluids (MRF) actuators. In UAV, MAV and microsatellites, actuators key drivers are often miniaturisation and low power. Embedded optic {\&} space instruments are leading to improved piezo actuators and motors.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {Conventional fossil fuel powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has limited flight range which totally depends on the fuel it carries. Too much fuel on board is not possible for the airplane application due to weight limitation. In addition, fossil fuels produce emissions and pollutants. The most favourable candidate energy source to power the UAVs is solar energy. With the PV panel and energy storage devices, the UAV can get enough energy for very long range flights and high enough power for the auxiliary electrical loads. This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system which is composed of PV panel, rechargeable fuel cell and rechargeable battery to solve the energy issues of long endurance UAV. Finally, the MATLAB/SIMULINK model of each component is constructed and the simulation results are shown.},

@article{Cutler2010,
abstract = {This paper explores the feasibility of improving unmanned air vehicle (UAV) mission effectiveness by extracting energy from the atmosphere. Specifically, we consider an aerial surveillance mission in the vicinity of a geographic ridge. Cross winds owing over the ridge produce regions of lift on the windward side that can be exploited to increase mission duration. Mission effectiveness is quantified using the seeability metric. Simulation results are presented for several observation target placements. Results indicate that seeability and imaging persistence can be improved by exploiting ridge lift. Simulations demonstrated that targets at ranges less than four times the ridge height were able to be observed over an indefinite period by a UAV with a glide ratio of 11:1.},

@article{Bradley2007,
abstract = {This paper describes the characteristics and performance of a fuel cell powered unmanned aircraft. The aircraft is novel as it is the largest compressed hydrogen fuel cell powered airplane built to date and is currently the only fuel cell aircraft whose design and test results are in the public domain. The aircraft features a 500 W polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell with full balance of plant and compressed hydrogen storage incorporated into a custom airframe. Details regarding the design requirements, implementation and control of the aircraft are presented for each major aircraft system. The performances of the aircraft and powerplant are analyzed using data from flights and laboratory tests. The efficiency and component power consumption of the fuel cell propulsion system are measured at a variety of flight conditions. The performance of the aircraft powerplant is compared to other 0.5-1 kW-scale fuel cell powerplants in the literature and means of performance improvement for this aircraft are proposed. This work represents one of the first studies of fuel cell powered aircraft to result in a demonstration aircraft. As such, the results of this study are of practical interest to fuel cell powerplant and aircraft designers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of the paper is to present a method for evaluating brushless DC motors (BLDC) for fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Selection of a BLDC motor, which operates in its efficient region for a UAV platform's specifications, will affect the endurance capabilities of the UAV platform. A four-constant model is presented as a means of modelling and predicting the characteristics of BLDC motors. Further, physical testing of each motor is performed on a constructed motor test bench. Validation of the model's results is compared to physical testing. The methods presented provide a means of accurately characterising a given BLDC motor. This data can be used to design the additional components used in the UAV's propulsion system.},
