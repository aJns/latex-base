abstract = {14.1 Introduction So-called classical studies on biaxial (combined stress) fatigue ranging from tension– compression to pure torsion under constant amplitude are well known. However, due to a lack of attention to the behaviour of small cracks, the effects of mechanical and microstructural factors on the fatigue strength of materials, containing small cracks and defects under biaxial or multiaxial stresses, have not been made clear. The behaviour of small fatigue cracks under multiaxial stress has been investigated by several workers [1–6]. Carbonell and Brown [3] investigated short crack growth under torsional low cycle fatigue in a medium carbon steel. They showed that short crack growth in torsional low cycle fatigue is similar to that in tension–compression low cycle fatigue. Socie et al. [4] investigated the behaviour of small semi-elliptical cracks under cyclic torsion and cyclic tension–torsion. They showed that strain-based intensity factors are useful correlating parameters for mixed mode small crack growth. Wang and Miller [5] studied the effect of mean shear stress on short crack growth under cyclic torsion. They showed that a mean shear stress promotes Stage I (Mode II) crack growth, and proposed a model to account for the effect of mean shear stress on fatigue life under torsional loading. Zhang and Akid [6] studied short crack growth in two steels under reversed cyclic torsion with an axial tensile or compressive mean stress. They pointed out that a compressive mean stress was beneficial to the life of both steels. Murakami and Endo [7] studied the effects of small defects and cracks in rotating bending and tension–compression fatigue, and proposed a prediction model based on the √ area parameter model (Chapter 5). Investigating the behaviour of small cracks using this model is useful in deciding whether the effect of small cracks on multiaxial fatigue is controlled by the Mode I threshold or that for the shear mode. The effects of small defects and small cracks on torsional fatigue strength are discussed in this chapter. The effects of artificial small defects on torsional fatigue strength have been studied in various materials using specimens which contain a small drilled hole as an initial defect [8–11,13]. The effects of an initial small crack on torsional fatigue have been studied by Murakami et al. [12]. The results of their experiment are useful in the understanding of crack branching and threshold phenomena under multiaxial fatigue. 248 Chapter 14 Figure 14.1 Relationship between fatigue limit and hole diameter in rotating bending and in reversed torsion. 14.2 Effect of Small Artificial Defects on Torsional Fatigue Strength 14.2.1 Ratio of Torsional Fatigue Strength to Bending Fatigue Strength Several studies have been performed in order to investigate the effect of small artificial defects on torsional fatigue strength [8–11,13]. Endo and Murakami [9] conducted both rotating bending and torsional fatigue tests on annealed 0.46{\%} C steel (S45C) specimens, which contained small artificial holes with diameters ranging from d = 40 to 500 µm. Fig. 14.1 illustrates the test results schematically. The value of d c in Fig. 14.1 is the critical hole diameter which does not affect fatigue strength. The value of d c in torsional fatigue is much larger than d c in rotating bending fatigue [9–13]. Later, similar rotating bending and torsional fatigue tests were carried out on a high carbon bearing steel, SUJ2 (equivalent to SAE 52100, H V = 740) by Nose et al. [10], on a nodular cast iron (H V = 190) by Endo [11], and on a maraging steel (H V = 740) by Murakami et al. [13]. The results of the fatigue tests on these four materials, where the depth of a hole is equal to its diameter, indicated that d c in rotating bending fatigue shows a clear dependence on the hardness of materials. In contrast, d c in torsional fatigue is approximately constant at 150 µm, irrespective of the material, that is of hardness [13]. The line B 2 C 2 is located at approximately 80{\%} of the line B 1 C 1 . This is primarily due to the difference in stress concentration factors (K t), at the hole, between tension (K t = 3) and torsion (K t = 4) (Fig. 14.2a,b).},

abstract = {Summary Third-generation (3G) wireless systems [2,3,9] offer access to services anywhere from a single terminal; the old boundaries between telephony, information, and entertainment services are disappearing. Mobility is built into many of the services currently considered as fixed, especially in such areas as high speed access to the Internet, entertainment, information, and electronic commerce (e-commerce) services. The distinction between the range of services offered via wireline or wireless is becoming less and less clear and, as the evolution toward 3G mobile services speeds up, these distinctions will disappear in the first decade of the new millennium.},

abstract = {This book provides comprehensive coverage of mobile data networking and mobile communications under a single cover for diverse audiences including managers, practicing engineers, and students who need to understand this industry. In the last two decades, many books have been written on the subject of wireless communications and networking. However, mobile data networking and mobile communications were not fully addressed in a unified fashion. This book fills that gap in the literature and is written to provide essentials of wireless communications and wireless networking, including Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), and Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN). The first ten chapters of the book focus on the fundamentals that are required to study mobile data networking and mobile communications. Numerous solved examples have been included to show applications of theoretical concepts. In addition, unsolved problems are given at the end of each chapter for practice. (A solutions manual will be available.)After introducing fundamental concepts, the book focuses on mobile networking aspects. Four chapters are devoted on the discussion of WPAN, WLAN, WWAN, and internetworking between WLAN and WWAN. Remaining seven chapters deal with other aspects of mobile communications such as mobility management, security, cellular network planning, and 4G systems.A unique feature of this book that is missing in most of the available books on wireless communications and networking is a balance between the theoretical and practical concepts. Moreover, this book can be used to teach a one/two semester course in mobile data networking and mobile communications to ECE and CS students.*Details the essentials of Wireless Personal Area Networks(WPAN), Wireless Local Are Networks (WLAN), and Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN)*Comprehensive and up-to-date coverage including the latest in standards and 4G technology*Suitable for classroom use in senior/first year grad level courses.

abstract = {In a post m o r t e m (after the fact) analysis, it is possible to wait for more observations to accumulate. In that case, the estimate can be improved by smoothing. -Andrew Jazwinski jJaz70, p. 1431 In previous chapters, we discussed how to obtain the optimal a priori and a posteriori state estimates. The a priori state estimate at time k, 2;, is the state estimate at time k based on all the measurements up to (but not including) time k. The a posteriori state estimate at time k, 2:, is the state estimate at time k based on all the measurements up to and including time k: There are often situations in which we want to obtain other types of state estimates. We will define 2 k , j as the estimate of X k given all measurements up to and including time j . With this notation, we see that Now suppose, for example, that we have recorded measurements up to time index 54 and we want to obtain an estimate of the state at time index 33. Our theory in Optimal State Estimation, First Edition. By Dan J. Simon ISBN 0471708585 02006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. 263 264 OPTIMAL SMOOTHING the previous chapters tells us how to obtain 2T3 or 2i'3f3, but those estimates only use the measurements up to and including times 32 and 33, respectively. If we have more measurements (e.g., measurements up to time 54) it stands to reason that we should be able to get an even better estimate of 233. This chapter discusses some ways of obtaining better estimates. In another scenario, it may be that we are interested in obtaining an estimate of the state at a fixed time j. As measurements keep rolling in, we want to keep updating our estimate 2j. In other words, we want to obtain 2 j , j + l , 2j,j+z, a. This could be the case, for example, if a satellite takes a picture at time j. In order to more accurately process the photograph at time j we need an estimate of the satellite state (position and velocity) at time j. As the satellite continues to orbit, we may obtain additional range measurements of the satellite, so we can continue to update the estimate of zj and thus improve the quality of the processed photograph. This situation is called fixed-point smoothing because the time point for which we want to obtain a state estimate (time j in this example) is fixed, but the number of measurements that are available to improve that estimate continually changes. Fixed-point smoothing is depicted in Figure 9.1 and is discussed in Section 9.2.},
