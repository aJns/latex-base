abstract = {A balloon-type airfoil, which has the classic airfoil shape but is full of air is designed in this paper. When the angle of attack changes, the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface will correspondingly be changed: the airfoil surface where the pressure is high will be pushed toward the inside of the airfoil resulting in the reduced curvature of this part of the airfoil and even a concave surface formed, but on the other hand, the curvature of the airfoil surface where the pressure is low will be increased. The initial shape of this adaptive reconfigurable airfoil used in this paper is NACA0012. As the forces acting on the airfoil surface should be in balance, a force balance equation is established at first. Then, the surface curvature of the airfoil as well as its shape can thereby be predicted. The flow field and the pressure distribution over the surface of the deformed airfoil can be simulated by use of the variational finite element method. In this paper, the pressure distribution over this adaptive airfoil as well as its corresponding shape under different incoming flows at angles of attack from -14 to 14 has been studied. At last, the XFoil software is used to calculate the coefficient of lift and drag and lift-to-drag ratio of the deformed airfoil. It has been found that this adaptive reconfigurable airfoil can automatically change its shape according to the pressure distribution over its surface and achieve better aerodynamic performance than NACA0012 airfoil in a wide range of application.

abstract = {Conventional fossil fuel powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has limited flight range which totally depends on the fuel it carries. Too much fuel on board is not possible for the airplane application due to weight limitation. In addition, fossil fuels produce emissions and pollutants. The most favourable candidate energy source to power the UAVs is solar energy. With the PV panel and energy storage devices, the UAV can get enough energy for very long range flights and high enough power for the auxiliary electrical loads. This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system which is composed of PV panel, rechargeable fuel cell and rechargeable battery to solve the energy issues of long endurance UAV. Finally, the MATLAB/SIMULINK model of each component is constructed and the simulation results are shown.},

abstract = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) is lightweight, produces high force and large deflection which makes it a suitable candidate for actuator in the adaptive airfoil system design. The deflection of a variable cambered wing is controlled by means of resistive heating of SMA actuator and cooling in the surrounding air. An experimental wing model was developed using ABS to test the application of the SMA actuators. The SMA actuators were fixed underneath the wing skin. The heating of the wires caused them to contract, creating a force and generating a moment which deflects the wing. A wind tunnel test was performed to investigate the change in lift to drag ratio of the wing when the actuator is switched on and off. The results proved that the use of ABS skin and SMA actuators in the wing model is reliable as significant change in lift to drag ratio was detected when the wing was morphed. Nomenclature},

abstract = {Surveying threatened and invasive species to obtain accurate population estimates is an important but challenging task that requires a considerable investment in time and resources. Estimates using existing ground-based monitoring techniques, such as camera traps and surveys performed on foot, are known to be resource intensive, potentially inaccurate and imprecise, and difficult to validate. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), artificial intelligence and miniaturized thermal imaging systems represent a new opportunity for wildlife experts to inexpensively survey relatively large areas. The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area. The system is flexible in that the user can readily define the types of objects to classify and the object characteristics that should be considered during classification.},

The aircraft is novel as it is the largest compressed hydrogen fuel cell powered airplane built to date and is currently the only fuel cell aircraft whose design and test results are in the public domain. The aircraft features a 500 W polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell with full balance of plant and compressed hydrogen storage incorporated into a custom airframe. Details regarding the design requirements, implementation and control of the aircraft are presented for each major aircraft system. The performances of the aircraft and powerplant are analyzed using data from flights and laboratory tests. The efficiency and component power consumption of the fuel cell propulsion system are measured at a variety of flight conditions. The performance of the aircraft powerplant is compared to other 0.5-1 kW-scale fuel cell powerplants in the literature and means of performance improvement for this aircraft are proposed. This work represents one of the first studies of fuel cell powered aircraft to result in a demonstration aircraft. As such, the results of this study are of practical interest to fuel cell powerplant and aircraft designers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to estimate a relative position of obstacles from vision-based measurements. The stochastic 2-test value is used to solve a correspondence problem between the measurements and the estimates that have been already obtained by then. A collision cone approach is used as a collision criteria in order to examine if there is any obstacle that is critical to the vehicle. A guidance strategy for collision avoidance is designed based on a minimum-effort guidance (MEG) method for multiple target tracking. The vision-based navigation and guidance designs suggested in this paper are integrated with realtime image processing algorithm and the entire vision-based control system are evaluated in the closed-loop 6 DoF flight simulation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a communication system in which unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used as relays between ground-based terminals and a network base station. We develop an algorithm for optimizing the performance of the ground-to-relay links through control of the UAV heading angle. To quantify link performance, we define the ergodic normalized transmission rate (ENTR) for the links between the ground nodes and the relay, and derive a closed-form expression for it in terms of the eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix. We show that the ENTR can be approximated as a sinusoid with an offset that depends on the heading of the UAV. Using this observation, we develop a closed-form expression for the UAV heading that maximizes the uplink network data rate while keeping the rate of each individual link above a certain threshold. When the current UAV relay assignments cannot meet the minimum link requirements, we investigate the deployment and heading control problem for new UAV relays as they are added to the network, and propose a smart handoff algorithm that updates node and relay assignments as the topology of the network evolves.},

The term energy harvesting describes the process of converting ambient energy surrounding a system into useful electrical energy through the use of a specific material or transducer. A widely studied form of energy harvesting involves the conversion of mechanical vibration en- ergy into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials, which exhibit electromechanical coupling between the electrical and mechanical domains. Typical piezoelectric energy har- vesting systems are designed as add-on systems to a host structure located in a vibration rich environment.

abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-deriva- tive (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of “intelligent” tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and “intelligent” techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of “plug-and-play” PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced produc- tivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

abstract = {Current production navigation systems for agricultural vehicles rely on GPS as the primary sensor for steering control. In citrus groves, where the tree canopy frequently blocks the satellite signals to the GPS receiver, an alternative method is required. This paper discusses the development of an autonomous guidance system for use in a citrus grove. The vehicle used for this study was a common tractor. Machine vision and laser radar (ladar) were individually used for guidance and a rotary encoder was used to provide feedback on the steering angle. A PID controller was developed to minimize the path error. The vehicle's guidance accuracy was tested in flexible test paths constructed of common hay bales. Path tracking performance was observed. The guidance system guided the tractor automatically through straight and curved paths. An average error of 2.8 cm using machine vision guidance and an average error of 2.5 cm using ladar guidance was observed, when the vehicle was tested in a curved path at a speed of 3.1 m/s. The guidance system successfully guided the vehicle in a citrus grove alleyway. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Herwitz2004,
abstract = {In September 2002, NASA's solar-powered Pathfinder-Plus unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to conduct a proof-of-concept mission in US national airspace above the 1500 ha plantation of the Kauai Coffee Company in Hawaii. While in national airspace, the transponder-equipped UAV was supervised by regional air traffic controllers and treated like a conventionally piloted aircraft. High resolution color and multispectral imaging payloads, both drawing from the aircraft's solar power system, were housed in exterior-mounted environmental pressure pods. A local area network (LAN) using unlicensed radio frequency was used for camera control and downlink of image data at rates exceeding 5 Mbit s-1. A wide area network (WAN) allowed a project investigator stationed on the US mainland to uplink control commands during part of the mission. Images were available for enhancing, printing, and interpretation within minutes of collection. The color images were useful for mapping invasive weed outbreaks and for revealing irrigation and fertilization anomalies. Multispectral imagery was related to mature fruit harvest from certain fields with significant fruit display on the tree canopy exterior. During 4 h "loitering" above the plantation, ground-based pilots were able to precisely navigate the UAV along pre-planned flightlines, and also perform spontaneous maneuvers under the direction of the project scientist for image collection in cloud-free zones. Despite the presence of ground-obscuring cumulus cloud cover of ca. 70{\%} during the image collection period, the UAV's maneuvering capability ultimately enabled collection of cloud-free imagery throughout most of the plantation. The mission demonstrated the capability of a slow-flying UAV, equipped with downsized imaging systems and line-of-sight telemetry, to monitor a localized agricultural region for an extended time period. The authors suggest that evolving long-duration (weeks to months) UAVs stand to make a valuable future contribution to regional agricultural resource monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An embedded system is an applied computer system, as distinguished from other types of computer systems such as personal computers (PCs) or supercomputers. When approaching embedded systems architecture design from a systems engineering point of view, several models can be applied to describe the cycle of embedded system design. Most of these models are based upon one or some combination of different development models: the big-bang model, in which there is essentially no planning or processes in place before and during the development of a system. Second, the code-and-fix model, in which product requirements are defined but no formal processes are in place before the start of development. Third, the waterfall model, in which there is a process for developing a system in steps, where results of one step flow into the next step. Fourth, the spiral model, in which there is a process for developing a system in steps, and throughout the various steps, feedback is obtained and incorporated back into the process. Further this chapter defines what an embedded system's architecture is in terms of the sum of the various representations of a system. The chapter also introduces why the architectural approach is used as the approach to introducing embedded concepts. This approach presents a clear visual of what the system is, or could be, composed of and how these elements function. In addition, this approach provides early indicators into what may and may not work in a system, and possibly improves the integrity of a system and lowers costs via reusability.},

The use of multiple networked UAVs as relay nodes can further enhance spectral and link connectivity. In this paper, we consider a multi-source cooperative communication system in which a number of small UAVs are used to relay the source signals to the destination nodes in a decode-and-forward manner. We analyze the outage probability at the relay UAVs and at the destination in a Rician fading environment. The use of single and multiple antennas at the destination node is considered and their respective performance is examined.

Applications for actuation are flight controls, landing gear, rotors, suspension, antennae steering, valves, scanning, positioning using hydraulic, electromechanical, magnetic and piezo actuators. In aircraft there is a common goal to reduce the number of hydraulic actuators in vehicles and eventually to replace them completely by electric actuators.

abstract = { Hybrid fuel cell/battery power sources have potentially widespread uses in applications wherein the power demand is impulsive rather than constant. Interposing a dc/dc converter between a fuel cell and a battery can create two configurations of actively controlled hybrid fuel cell/battery power sources. Those two configurations are compared using both theory and experiment with special attention to the peak power enhancement, and power losses in the converter. Both of the defined configurations were built, using a 35 W polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, an 8-cell lithium-ion battery pack, and a high-efficiency power converter. Both two configurations yielded a peak power output of 135 W, about 4 times as high as the fuel cell alone could supply, with only a slight (13{\%}) increase of weight. The converter losses were quantitatively analyzed. Which of the two configurations yields a smaller loss depends on the load power demand characteristics including peak power and load duty ratio. The study results provide guidance for the design of hybrid sources according to the particular load power requirements.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown promise in recent years for autonomous sensing. UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.},

Specifically, we consider an aerial surveillance mission in the vicinity of a geographic ridge. Cross winds owing over the ridge produce regions of lift on the windward side that can be exploited to increase mission duration. Mission effectiveness is quantified using the seeability metric. Simulation results are presented for several observation target placements. Results indicate that seeability and imaging persistence can be improved by exploiting ridge lift. Simulations demonstrated that targets at ranges less than four times the ridge height were able to be observed over an indefinite period by a UAV with a glide ratio of 11:1.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of how to make a UAV track a given flight trajectory while at the same time avoid unexpected obstacle(s). If the information about the existence of the obstacle is known in advance, the problem can be readily solved by carefully pre-planning the desired flight path for the vehicle. However, obstacle(s) might appear unexpectedly in practical applications, as such the pre-planned flight path might become "misleading" to the vehicle if no correcting action is taken. Furthermore, obstacles might be of any shape (not necessarily a point mass) and might be either inert or hostile (including seeking a collision). How to avoid unexpected, irregular, even moving obstacles while maintaining close path tracking of UAV is an interesting yet challenging problem. In this paper, we explore fuzzy logic based approach to path tracking and obstacle avoidance. We consider the case that obstacles are either still or moving and appear along the predetermined flight path unexpectedly. By using suitable sensors we identify the relative distance between the vehicle and the obstacle and make timely adjustment to the pre-planned flight path. Fuzzy logic control algorithms are developed to achieve close path tracking while avoiding obstacles. Simulation studies on multiple obstacles with various shapes are conducted and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified},

Two control laws are defined: one based on proportional integrative derivative (PID) controllers both for inner and outer loops and one based on the combination of PIDs and an adaptive controller. Findings Good results can be obtained in terms of trajectory tracking (based on waypoints) and of parameter variations. The adaptive control law guarantees smoothing responses and less oscillations and glitches on the control deflections.
